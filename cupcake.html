            <li><em>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</em></li>
            <li><em>
                Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with buttermilk. Begin and end 
                with the dry ingredients.

            <li><em>Gently fold in the diced strawberries until evenly distributed in the batter.</em></li>
            <li><em>Spoon the batter into the prepared cupcake liners, filling each about two-thirds full.</em></li>
