        <h2><em>Ingredientsüç°</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>2 cups shredded coconut</em></li>
            <li><em>1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk</em></li>
            <li><em>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</em></li>
            <li><em>2 egg whites</em></li>
            <li><em>1/4 teaspoon salt</em></li>
            <li><em>1/2 cup powdered sugar</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2><em>Steps‚ú®</em></h2>
        <ol>
            <li><em>
                Preheat and Prepare: Preheat your oven to 
                325¬∞F (163¬∞C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
            </em></li>
            <li><em>
                Mix the Coconut Base:
                In a bowl, combine shredded coconut, sweetened condensed milk, and vanilla extract. 
                Mix until well combined, creating a sticky and cohesive coconut mixture.
            </em></li>
            <li><em>
                Whip the Egg Whites:In a separate clean, dry bowl, whip the egg whites with salt until 
                stiff peaks form. This adds airiness to the macaroons.
            </em></li>
            <li><em>
                Fold in Egg Whites: Gently fold the whipped egg whites into the coconut mixture. 
                Be careful not to deflate the egg whites; the goal is to maintain a light and fluffy texture.
            </em></li>
            <li><em>
                Shape the Macaroons: Using a spoon or cookie scoop, shape the coconut mixture into small 
                mounds and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Leave space between each mound as 
                the macaroons will slightly spread during baking.
            </em></li>
            <li><em>
                Dust with Powdered Sugar: Sprinkle the tops of the macaroons with powdered sugar,
                adding a sweet finishing touch.
            </em></li>
            <li><em>
                Bake to Golden Perfection: Bake in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes 
                or until the macaroons turn golden brown on the edges.
            </em></li>
            <li><em>
                Cool and Enjoy: Allow the macaroons to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before 
                transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, indulge in these delightful treats!
