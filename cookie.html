        <h2><em>Ingredientsüç™</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</em></li>
            <li><em>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</em></li>
            <li><em>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</em></li>
            <li><em>1/2 cup granulated sugar</em></li>
            <li><em>1 cup packed brown sugar</em></li>
            <li><em>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</em></li>
            <li><em>2 large eggs</em></li>
            <li><em>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2><em>Steps‚ú®</em></h2>
        <ol>
            <li><em>
                Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 375¬∞F (190¬∞C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
             </em></li>
            <li><em>
                Combine Dry Ingredients: In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour and baking soda. 
                Set aside.
            </em></li>
            <li><em>
                Cream Butter and Sugars: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, 
                brown sugar, and vanilla extract until the mixture is light and fluffy.
            </em></li>
            <li><em>
                Add Eggs: Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. This creates a smooth, 
                creamy base for your cookie dough.
            </em></li>
            <li><em>
                Incorporate Dry Ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients, 
                mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; you want a soft, tender cookie.
            </em></li>
            <li><em>
                Fold in Chocolate Chips: Gently fold in the semisweet chocolate chips, distributing them evenly 
                throughout the cookie dough. This step is where the magic happens!
            </em></li>
            <li><em>
                Scoop Dough onto Baking Sheet: Use a cookie scoop or a spoon to drop rounded portions of dough 
                onto the prepared baking sheet. Ensure they are spaced at least 2 inches apart to allow for spreading.
            </em></li>
            <li><em>
                Bake to Golden Perfection: Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes or until the edges 
                are golden brown. The centers may still look slightly underdone ‚Äì that's okay; they'll continue to 
                set as they cool.
            </em></li>
            <li><em>
                Cool on Wire Rack: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring 
                them to a wire rack to cool completely.

            </em></li>
            <li><em>
                Indulge and Enjoy: Once cooled, your chocolate chip cookies are ready to be devoured. Grab a glass of 
                milk and savor the deliciousness!
